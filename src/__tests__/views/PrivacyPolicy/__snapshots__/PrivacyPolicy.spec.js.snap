        <p>
          Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser 
                    (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain
                    information. 
          <b>
            For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process your area of interests (amidst our various categories 
                    of contents, be it Sports, Entertainment, Politics, Business, Health and Technology) based on your interactions on our platform.

                    experiences in the future.
