        Leveraging state-of-the-art AI techniques,
        we want to create a content-driven social platform that gives
        journalists and other content creators a medium to share quality
        content to an ever-engaging community of people who want to be a part of the story.

        For you, the users,
        we want you to take part and enjoy interacting with
        content from across the globe, things that are
        important to you and to make your voice heard.
        Bloverse filters content by interests, country,
        comments and interactions to ensure you
        consume what is relevant to you.
        With our ranking system we aim to prevent information
        overload and attempting to fight fake news by ensuring
        that you consume content from those who know what they are talking about.
