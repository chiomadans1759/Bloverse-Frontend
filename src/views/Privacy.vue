                    <p> We understand that when you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. This privacy policy

                    </p>

                    </ul>

                    <h5 id="l6">How do we protect your information?</h5>
                    <ul>  
                        <li>
                            <b>Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</b><br/>
                            Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive information you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

                            <br/><br/>We implement a variety of security measures when a user enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.

                            <br/><br/>All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.

                        </li>
                        <li>We do not use vulnerability scanning and/or scanning to PCI standards.</li>
                        <li>We only provide articles and information.</li>
                        <li>We use regular Malware Scanning.</li>
                        <li>We do not request for credit card information but we are in conjunction with some <b>Payment providers</b></li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5 id="l7">Payment Providers</h5>
                    <p>
                        We are in conjunction with several payment providers, including; Paypal, Visa, Money transfer
                        through which our users receive payment based on their interaction with content. Those companies 
                        acting as payment providers may collect and store personal bank account information in order to 
                        provide their services, and may collect and store personal data and business data to prevent fraud
                        and other abuse.<br/><br/>

                        If you want to delete your bank account information, you will need to do so with your payment provider, 
                        as we (Bloverse) only have minimal secure access to those records as needed to provide the services.
                    </p>

                    <h5 id="l8">Third-party disclosure</h5>
                    <p>
                        We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless
                        we provide users with advance notice and you request or authorize. This does not include website hosting 
                        partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our 
                        users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information 
                        when it's release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety. <br/><br/>

                        However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, 
                        advertising, or other uses.
                    </p>

                    <p>We may create links to other websites. We will make a reasonable effort to link only to sites that meet similar standards 
                        for maintaining each individual's right to privacy. However, many other sites that are not associated with or authorized
                        by our company may have links leading to our site. Our company cannot control these links and we are not responsible
                        for any content appearing on these sites. Since this website does not control the privacy policies of third 
                        parties, you are subject to the privacy practices of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before 
                        you disclose any personal information to others.<br/><br/>

                        Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

                    <h5 id="l13">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h5>
                    <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years 
                        old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal 
                        Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells
                        out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br/><br/>
                        We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

                        collected. We will also retain and use your personal information for as long as necessary to comply with our 
                        legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
                    </p>
