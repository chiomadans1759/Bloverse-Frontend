# BLOVERSE FRONTEND STYLEGUIDE

##### The purpose of this is to set some rules to help the frontend team harmonize on coding style. The belief is that
##### uniformity would aid in easier debugging, integration and collaboration among the frontend developers in the
##### Bloverse project

## RULE ONE
Indent codes properly, kindly use 2 spaces instead of 4. Kindly view this post on [stackoverflow](https://www.google.com) to find out how to best configure your tab keypad for 2 spaces for VSCODE users.

## RULE TWO
Kindly start every component html with the main tag e.g
```<main></main>```

## RULE THREE
Please indent html tags properly

## RULE FOUR
Prefix css class with the component name e.g PostDisplay.vue component classes should be prefixed with ```.post-display```

## RULE FIVE
Please give spaces among class definitions in your css file e.g
```
.class-one {

}

.class-two {

}

```

and not 

``` 
.class-one {

}
.class-two {

}
```

## RULE SIX
For general css classes, follow component naming conventions. So for instance a button can be seen as a component, kindly follow [bootstrap's](http://getbootstrap.com/) naming convention
